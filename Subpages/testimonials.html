                        and keeps my dad's home better than it was before! I'm so happy we found Rose's Agency! Please let Gary know as well

                    <p>"I can't thank you enough for the support your agency provided my mother during her time of greatest need. Despite her 
                        always changing care requirements and the daily (even hourly) fluctuations in the hours she needed, you always managed 
                        to stay on top of it.  Whenever we needed it, even on just a few hours notice, you sent excellent workers who were polite, 
                        hard-working and motivated to help my mom however she needed. You always sought our feedback and did your best to pair 
                        her with the helpers she most clicked with. Through all of this you truly demonstrated an unwavering commitment to customer 
                        service. I would definitely recommend you and Rose to others in need of home care services."</p>

                    <p>"We had an excellent experience with Rose's Agency Home Care. Our 100 year old mother was diagnosed with COVID and we had to 
                        arrange for care long distance as we don't live in LA. Rose's Agency responded immediately and provided a very competent 
                        caregiver who lived in with our mom through her illness. We had called several different agencies and Rose's was the only 
                        one who immediately committed in the first phone call to help us out, particularly impressive given our mom's COVID 
                        diagnosis. We are appreciative for all the Rose's Agency did for our family during this difficult time."</p>

                    <p>"I talked to Tashma on the phone about getting transportation to and from the hospital and home care for two (2) hours a day 
                        after my surgery. She arranged to come see me with Gary, the owner. She arranged to have Zac, an Asian male care giver 
                        provide the home health care. I felt comfortable with the service that we agreed upon."</p>

                        all the way for us. We could rely on you and Tashma to help her through some very difficult times. Every caregiver Tashma 
                        sent was special. Lynne totally bonded with Raven and she was such a good companion for her. Wendy tells me that Evelyn 
                        was equally special and made her life much easier. Thanks to Martha and Rafael too. They made the house livable for all 
                        concerned, I’ve known it wasn’t an easy job, but they never complained and worked so hard. Thank you for making her end 
                        of life so peaceful. Thank you for everything!"</p>

                <div class="gridquote quote6">
                    <p>"I cannot say enough wonderful things about Rose's Agency. I was referred to them by a colleague. My mother and father 
                        (now deceased) had several phenomenal Caregivers. My mother (who requires 2-24 hour Caregivers) has the most kind, 
                        empathic, diligent Caregivers, the list goes on! When there are issues that develop between the Caregivers, which is 
                        inevitable, Gary from Rose's has been available and jumps on it. He solves the issue without shame, which is critical 
                        because no one is saddled with unhappy feelings which he/she would attach to the job/the patient. My mother's Caregivers 
                        go above and beyond what is asked of them. One of them adds so much levity, so much joy to the house-they definitely threw 
                        the mold out after they made her! Truly, I have never, ever felt any unease leaving my mom to be cared for by them. Above 
                        all, please know that Rose's Agency takes their job very seriously and this is reflected in the candidates and their 
                        attention to any issue. Please do not be swayed by the poor reviews...those problems were swiftly taken care of and the 
                        ship was righted once again.”</p>

                        Rose’s Agency Home Care has become someone my mother can depend on. Clementine is a Caregiver and companion to my mother, 
                        and she has made my mother’s life much easier. Additionally, Gary has been an effective communicator and is always easy
