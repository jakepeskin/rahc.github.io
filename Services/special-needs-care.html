      <h2>Providing in-home care is a great way to help autistic family members connect with outsiders in a safe and comfortable environment</h2>
        </br>
        <p>To ease daily routines for people with autism, our caregivers focus on creating safe home environments, 
            establishing good habits, and encouraging learning opportunities.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="grey">

          <h3>How In-Home Care Can Help Individuals with Autism</h3>
        
          <div class="textcontainer">
                    
            <p class="top-p">In-home caregivers have the opportunity to play a critical support role in the lives of people with autism spectrum disorder 
                (ASD). Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that impacts social interaction, communication and behavior. Since it is a 
                lifelong condition, people with autism tend to require extra assistance and support in their day-to-day lives.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Caregivers can step into this role and develop a deep understanding of an autistic person’s individual strengths, challenges, 
                and interests. Having this support can help reduce anxiety, promote security, and enhance daily skills such as meal 
                preparation, personal hygiene, and housekeeping. </p>
                <br>
            <p>In-home caregivers are also able to offer much-needed emotional support by being a compassionate and understanding presence 
                in the lives of autistic individuals. This may open up social opportunities, closer family bonds, and improved adherence 
                to any behavior or therapy plans.</p>

        <h3>How We Care for Those with Autism & Special Needs</h3>
      
        <div class="textcontainer">
                  
          <h4>1. Socialization & Communication</h4>  
          <p>Our caregivers help people with special needs improve socialization & communication skills by using fun activities. 
            Interacting with people outside their families while still being safe at home can be very beneficial for people with autism. 
            By using games as a medium, caregivers are able to break down challenges people may have in sharing their thoughts and 
            connecting with others. Our team also uses positive reinforcement to reward good behavior, such as awarding them with stickers. 
            Praising specific behaviors and learning efforts can go a long way in helping people with autism or special needs.</p>

        <h4>2. Expanding Sensory Experiences</h4>  
        <p>Experiencing new stimuli can be scary for people with special needs, especially when it takes place in an unfamiliar environment. 
            By working with our caregivers, we make it possible for people to have these beneficial experiences at home where they feel safe 
            and secure. Our team shows autistic individuals new colors, noise levels, and textures to help expand their senses and learn 
            which stimuli elicit positive and negative behaviors. Understanding what affects autistic people can help prevent difficult 
            situations and create more positive experiences in the future.</p>
        
        <h4>3. Assisting With Medications</h4>
        <p>People with special needs may need assistance in managing medications as their disease progresses. With multiple prescriptions, 
            it can be difficult to keep track of the various medications that need to be taken on a regular basis. Thankfully, our 
            caregivers are highly experienced in this area and help remind patients to take their medication at the right time.</p>
        
        <h4>4. Providing Familial Support</h4>
        <p>Getting some assistance can provide valuable peace of mind, as caring for people with special needs can become overwhelming. 
            Our caregivers understand how to step in and give family members a break from the stresses of managing daily tasks. We work 
            with families to design individual personal care plans that meet their specific needs and reduce their worries about 
            effectively caring for their loved ones.</p>

        <h4>5. Teaching Life Skills</h4>
        <p>Creating consistency with special needs individuals is a great way to reinforce learning and teach them new skills. Our 
            caregivers work with individuals to create highly-structured schedules for mealtimes, education, therapy, and sleep. 
            Autistic individuals crave consistency and do their best in a structured environment. We use this approach to expand 
            learning opportunities and teach activities such as laundry, preparing meals, and getting dressed.</p>

          <h3>Autism Triggers: What They Are and How to Plan for Them</h3>
        
          <div class="textcontainer">
                    
            <h4>Common Triggers for Kids With Autism:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Bright or fluorescent lights</li>
                <li>Loud or sudden noises</li>
                <li>Clothing that doesn't feel good on their skin</li>
                <li>Being in social groups or crowded areas</li>
                <li>Having a change in their usual routine</li>
            </ul>
                <br>
            <p>Autism triggers can be very different for every child. Learn what they are for your child, and help prepare for them. 
                Learn what they are, and help your child prepare for them.</p>
            
            <h4>What you can do:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand that your child's reactions to these triggers are because of autism and how their brain reacts to 
                    emotional experiences and things around them (stimuli). It is not their fault that they react differently than 
                    others. Their behavior is a way that they self-regulate, or cope with the stresses they experience.</li>
                <li>Be curious. Observe and notice what’s going on for your child so you can start to identify when these triggers 
                    might happen.</li>
                <li>Help your child prepare ahead of time if a possible trigger situation is coming up.  Sometimes drawing a simple 
                    plan can help your child know what to expect.</li>
                <li>Create a comfortable environment to minimize these triggers and decrease stress (adjust the lights, get socks 
                    without seams, noise canceling headphones, etc.)</li>
                <li>Identify a calm place they can go when they feel upset. This may be sitting with a heavy blanket, in a fort, on 
                    your lap, or in a quiet corner in their school.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Finding the right caregiver</h3>
      
        <div class="textcontainer">
                  
          <p class="top-p">Adults with autism often require special attention and care while they are home and can not be left alone. 
            The care that they receive is vital to their quality of life and advancement. If you are  taking care of an adult or 
            someone over 16 years old you may understand how the difficulties can affect your daily life and you may find yourself 
            needing help. There are many companies which provide these services and hiring an individual who can communicate effectively 
            with your loved one is important to their well-being.</p>

            <br>

         <p>You will want to choose an experienced professional — particularly someone who specializes in working with adults with autism. 
            Someone who:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is compassionate</li>
                <li>Has patience</li>
                <li>Pays attention to detail</li>
                <li>Is dependable</li>
                <li>Is trustworthy</li>
            </ul>

        <br>

        <p>Without these qualities the professional would never be able to be effective with the person who requires care.</p>

        <h4>Responsibilities of the Caregiver</h4>
        <p>Unlike common caregivers, those who help individuals with autism may not have to provide grooming, toileting, and dressing 
            services to the patient. However, they would generally need to oversee almost all activities of the adult that they tend 
            to at all times. Even Though there is no cure for autism, there are methods which can be put in place to help individuals 
            with social behavior and communication problems.</p>

          <h3>Tips in Caring for Autistic Children</h3>
        
          <div class="textcontainer">
            
            <h4>1. Talk with the child’s parents first</h4>
            <p>Before approaching the patient, talk with the child’s parents first to get a baseline expectation on how the patient would 
                react to you. By doing your research, you can also plan on the best way to approach the patient. Ask the parent about the 
                child’s past medical history, activities that help sooth him and the best way of communication fit for him. Let the child 
                observe as you talk with the parent to initially establish trust with the patient.</p>

            <h4>2.  Do physical assessment away from the child but progressively moving centrally</h4>
            <p>Start first with visual inspection. As the child shows cooperation, move forward with hands and feet. Then continue doing 
                assessment by progressively moving centrally until you can assess the child’s body or trunk. Autistic children get easily 
                stressed by sudden intimate touch so you need to have a tailored approach in doing physical assessment to them.</p>
