        <h2>Our caregivers support cancer patients with compassionate,<br>high-quality care</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Here at Rose’s, our experienced caregivers work hard to reduce patient stress by easing their burden and assisting with 
            tedious everyday tasks.​</p>

          <h3>How We Care for Cancer Patients</h3>
        
          <img class="cancerpic1" src="../Services/Cancer-Images/cancer-carePic1.webp">
        
            <div class="textcontainer">
                
                <h4>Be their Sounding Board</h4> 
                <p>Carefully listening to our cancer patients is essential for our team of caregivers. Doing so helps us foster trust, 
                    emotional support, and effective communication with our patients. People with cancer can have specific needs, 
                    preferences, or side effects they need to discuss with their caregivers. Our caregivers understand the importance of 
                    listening to theses details and serving as a sounding board by relaying information to healthcare professionals when 
                    appropriate.</p>

                <h4>Be their Go-To Angel</h4> 
                <p>Our caregivers provide tremendous value to cancer patients by assisting with difficult or stressful tasks. They do so 
                    by communicating effectively and tailoring their assistance to each patient's unique needs and preferences. By working 
                    together, our team identifies the best ways to help with various tasks such as household chores, medication management, 
                    paperwork, meal preparation, and transportation.</p>
            
            </div>

            <img class="cancerpic2" src="../Services/Cancer-Images/cancer-carePic2.webp">

            <div class="textcontainer">

                <h4>Bring comfort</h4> 
                <p>People with cancer may need some assistance when it comes to consistently managing their medication. With multiple 
                    prescriptions, it can be difficult to keep track of the various medications that need to be taken on a regular basis. 
                    Thankfully, our caregivers are highly experienced in this area and help remind patients to take their medication at the 
                    right time.</p>
                
                <h4>Be their voice</h4>
                <p>Our caregivers play an important role for cancer patients when it comes to assisting with communication. This may 
                    include advocating on their behalf when it comes to healthcare needs or encouraging their friends and family to visit 
                    and provide emotional support. Our team of caregivers can also ensure reliable information is being provided about each 
                    patient's condition, treatment options, and any side effects at play.</p>
                
                <h4>Supporting Nutrition and Healthy Eating Habits</h4>
                <p>Helping cancer patients with good nutrition and healthy eating habits is a key priority for our caregiving team. We work 
                    closely with each patient to ensure their unique nutritional needs are being met. Doing so can significantly impact 
                    their quality of life and overall health during their cancer treatment journey. Our caregivers work diligently to support 
                    patients with mean planning and timing, food preparation, and hydration.</p>
            
            </div>
                
            <img class="cancerpic3" src="../Services/Cancer-Images/cancer-carePic3.webp">

            <div class="textcontainer">

                <h4>Helping patients stay active</h4>
                <p>Rose's caregivers know how important it is for cancer patients to maintain their physical strength through activity. 
                    Doing so can boost their well-being and help mitigate the side effects of cancer treatment. Our caregivers work with 
                    each patient to understand which physical activities are best based on their diagnosis and treatment plan. Setting 
                    realistic goals and encouraging daily movement are helpful ways in which our team members make activity easier for 
                    patients. We also monitor fatigue levels closely, ensure patient safety, and provide support with pain management 
                    whenever necessary.</p>

                <h4>Assisting with medications</h4>
                <p>Cancer patients can often have multiple medications that can be difficult to stay on top of. Thankfully our caregivers 
                    are highly trained when it comes to medication management and know how to help patients stick to their regimens. We 
                    make it easy to organize all prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and vitamins. Our caregivers also 
                    help administer medication in a timely manner and assist with pills or injections whenever necessary. Monitoring side 
                    effects and pain levels is also an essential part of the way we support cancer patients on a regular basis. Medication 
                    management is an essential component of cancer care and our caregivers play a vital role in ensuring medications are 
                    taken in a safe and accurate manner. </p>
                
                <h4>Providing Incontinence & Personal Care</h4>
                <p>Our caregivers understand how to help cancer patients manage incontinence issues while ensuring they maintain their 
                    dignity and self-respect. We also assist patients with carrying out personal care tasks such as bathing, dressing, 
                    and hygiene. It is important for our team to support patients in ways that respect their privacy and provide additional 
                    comfort. For these reasons, we work to maintain open communication about any incontinence and personal care concerns 
                    they may have. Our team also promotes independence in these areas whenever possible and makes sure each patient feels 
                    supported and reassured during these activities.</p>

            <img class="cancerpic4" src="../Services/Cancer-Images/cancer-carePic4.webp">

            <div class="textcontainer">

                <h4>Transportation</h4>
                <p>Our caregiving team has years of experience safely driving cancer patients to doctor’s appointments, rehabilitation 
                    sessions, pharmacies, and more. We can help with many aspects of transportation such as coordination, planning, and 
                    mobility assistance. Our caregivers also aim to provide good company during the journey and do their best to create a 
                    pleasant experience for patients. For our team, we strive to support both the physical and emotional journey of cancer 
                    patients as they get transported to their different appointments and support organizations.</p>
